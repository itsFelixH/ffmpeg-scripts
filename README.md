Collection of various small ffmpeg Bash, CMD & PS scripts to use with FFmpeg. Here you can find:

Feel free to ask me questions via Discord or make suggestions on what I need to add here.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsFelixH/ffmpeg-scripts.git
```

You might need to tweak the parameters in order to get internet-shareable sizes.
